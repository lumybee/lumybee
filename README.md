### 🙋🏻 Welcome to My Github Page

<p>
  I am a university student. I am learning how to code and currently focusing on how to be a Front End Developer because making websites using HTML and CSS fasinates me. I am now focusing on C++ also and hope that I will enjoy this language too
</p>
<ul>
  <li>💻 I am currently learning react and C++</li>
  <li>🚧 I am focusing on making small and good looking webpages and learning how to make them perfect</li>
  <li>🎧 I like listen to Mitski</li>
  <li>💤 I like to sleep in free time</li>
</ul>
